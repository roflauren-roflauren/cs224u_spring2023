    "This assignment is about _compositional generalization_. We are going to assess the degree to which our apparently very good models have learned to process and interpret language _systematically_. To do this, we are going to ask them to interpret novel combinations of familiar words and phrases. For humans, these tasks are very easy. For our models, the situation seems to be quite different.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basis for the assignment is the ReCOGS dataset of [Wu, Manning, and Potts 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13716). ReCOGS modifies the COGS dataset of [Kim and Linzen 2020](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.731) in a number of ways, with the goal of more directly assessing the interpretive abilities of models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment questions are fairly diverse. Question 1 asks you to conduct a specific analysis of the ReCOGS dataset, and Question 2 follows this up with a corresponding analysis of the errors made by a top-performing ReCOGS model. For Question 3, you try some in-context learning with DSP. And then we open things up as usual: you can do anything you want for your original system, and you enter that system's predictions into a bakeoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is only one rule that we need to enforce throughout this work:\n",
    "\n",
    "__You cannot train your system on any examples from `dataset[\"gen\"]`, nor can the output representations from those examples be included in any prompts used for in-context learning.__\n",

    "Now that we are set up to use the model, we can move to Question 2. There is just one final preliminary: for ReCOGs, we want to come as close as possible to assessing systems purely on semantic criteria, as opposed to assessing their ability to predict arbitrary features of logical forms. In particular, we want predictions to be independent of the particular choice of variable names and independent of the order of conjuncts. "
